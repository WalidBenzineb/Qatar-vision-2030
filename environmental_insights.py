        "Total CO₂ emissions rose by 32.42% from 87.4 million tonnes in 2016 to 115.7 million tonnes in 2023, showing a concerning upward trajectory.",
        "CO₂ emissions per capita increased by 15.54% from 33.62 tonnes in 2016 to 38.84 tonnes in 2023, maintaining Qatar's position among the world's highest per capita emitters.",
        "The data shows an accelerating emissions trend, with the most significant jump occurring between 2022 and 2023 (9% increase in just one year).",
        "The rising emissions directly conflict with Qatar's environmental sustainability goals under Vision 2030 and its international climate commitments.",
        "Qatar's per capita emissions (38.84 tonnes) are approximately 8x the global average (4.8 tonnes) and higher than regional peers (Kuwait: 25 tonnes, UAE: 20 tonnes, Saudi Arabia: 18 tonnes)."

electricity_insights = [
        "Fossil fuels generate over 99.7% of Qatar's electricity, with renewables contributing a minimal 0.28-0.31% throughout the period.",
        "Total electricity production increased by 28.2% from 42.44 TWh in 2016 to 54.39 TWh in 2023, driving up absolute emissions.",
        "Despite global renewable energy trends, Qatar's renewable electricity generation has plateaued at around 0.15 TWh since 2018.",
        "The data reveals a significant gap between Qatar's sustainability rhetoric and actual energy transformation progress.",
        "Global electricity mix shows 61% non-renewables vs 39% renewables, while Qatar targets 20% renewables by 2030, significantly above the Middle East average (4%) but below global average (29%)."

solar_insights = [
        "Solar capacity experienced a remarkable 15,686% increase from 0.0051 GW in 2016 to 0.8051 GW in 2023.",
        "Almost all capacity growth occurred in a single year (2022), indicating a major infrastructure commissioning.",
        "Despite the capacity increase, the solar electricity generation data doesn't yet show a corresponding production increase, suggesting the new capacity may be at early operational stages.",
        "This dramatic solar expansion aligns with Qatar's National Development Strategy and preparations for hosting the 2022 FIFA World Cup.",
        "Qatar's 2030 target of 4 GW solar capacity would place it among the regional leaders in renewable capacity per capita, though still modest by global standards."

    # New insights for Energy Change chart that was missing dedicated insights
energy_change_insights = [
        "Qatar's annual change in primary energy consumption shows significant volatility, with both substantial growth and contraction periods.",
        "The 2020 pandemic year saw the most dramatic energy consumption contraction, reflecting global economic slowdown and reduced industrial activity.",
        "Post-pandemic recovery shows a return to positive growth rates in energy consumption, potentially challenging sustainability targets.",
        "Qatar's typical annual energy consumption growth (5-6% in the 2010s) far exceeds the global average (1.9% in 2022), reflecting Qatar's rapid development and energy-intensive economy.",
        "Vision 2030 initiatives aim to moderate Qatar's energy consumption growth to below 3% annually by the late 2020s through efficiency improvements and renewable integration, though this would still exceed typical developed economy growth rates."

    # New insights for Renewable Electricity Production Detail chart that was missing dedicated insights
renewable_detail_insights = [
        "Qatar's renewable electricity generation is dominated by solar power, accounting for nearly all renewable output since 2018.",
        "Bioenergy makes a minimal contribution to Qatar's renewable mix, with very limited growth over the monitoring period.",
        "Qatar's total renewable electricity production (0.15 TWh) is a fraction of the Middle East's already low renewable generation (47 TWh in 2022) and insignificant compared to global renewables (7,858 TWh in 2021).",
        "The dramatic increase in solar capacity in 2022-2023 has not yet translated to substantial increases in electricity generation, suggesting early operational stages or potential utilization challenges.",
        "Qatar's National Renewable Energy Strategy target of 4 GW solar capacity by 2030 would dramatically increase renewable electricity production, helping Qatar progress from its current 0.3% renewable share toward its 20% target."

agricultural_insights = [
        "Agricultural land increased from 71,000 hectares in 2016 to 74,000 hectares in 2021 (4.23% growth), reflecting Qatar's food security strategy.",
        "Arable land saw more significant growth of 14.75% (18,300 to 21,000 hectares), indicating intensified cultivation efforts.",
        "These increases align with Qatar's post-2017 blockade strategy to enhance domestic food production and reduce import dependence.",
        "The expansion of agriculture in Qatar's challenging desert environment demonstrates technological innovation in climate-adapted farming.",
        "Qatar's agricultural productivity (~$10-11K per worker) exceeds regional peers like Oman (~$6K) but remains below advanced economies (>$50K per worker)."

overall_environmental_insights = [
        "The data reveals a significant disconnect between Qatar's Vision 2030 environmental sustainability goals and actual progress, particularly in emissions and energy transition.",
        "While showing impressive progress in solar capacity expansion and agricultural development, Qatar has made limited headway in overall emissions reduction and renewable energy integration.",
        "With CO₂ emissions accelerating rather than decreasing, Qatar faces a critical decision point regarding its climate strategy credibility.",
        "Despite significant investments in renewable capacity (particularly solar), the impact on the overall energy mix remains minimal.",
        "The data highlights Qatar's complex sustainability challenge in balancing food security, water conservation, and energy transition in a desert environment.",
        "Qatar's per capita emissions (8x global average) and fossil-fuel dominated electricity mix (99.7%) contrast with its ambitious Vision 2030 sustainability goals."
