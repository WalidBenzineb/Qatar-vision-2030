        "Oil production declined from 582.57 TWh in 2016 to a low of 511.54 TWh in 2020 (-12.2%), but has since recovered to 616.21 TWh in 2023.",
        "The initial reduction reflects Qatar's strategic decision to focus more on natural gas, where it holds comparative advantage.",
        "The 20.5% increase from 2020 to 2023 shows Qatar's response to higher global energy demand and prices after the pandemic.",
        "The upward trend in recent years raises questions about alignment with climate commitments and sustainability goals.",
        "Qatar's oil output (~0.67 million barrels/day) is modest compared to other GCC producers, reflecting its strategic focus on natural gas production."

gas_insights = [
        "Qatar has been investing heavily in liquefied natural gas (LNG) infrastructure, aiming to increase production capacity from 77 to 126 million tons annually by 2027.",
        "The focus on gas aligns with Qatar's positioning of natural gas as a 'transition fuel' with lower carbon emissions than oil or coal.",
        "Sustained gas production provides Qatar with economic stability as global demand for cleaner burning fuels increases.",
        "The vast majority of Qatar's gas production is destined for export markets, making it a critical component of the country's revenue stream.",

        "Energy consumption fluctuated significantly, from 168.92 TWh in 2016 to a low of 126.88 TWh in 2020 (-24.9%), before rebounding to 170.21 TWh in 2023.",
        "The consumption pattern closely mirrors GDP trends, with the 2020 pandemic-related drop and subsequent recovery.",
        "The data suggests limited progress in improving energy efficiency, as consumption has grown in line with economic recovery.",
        "Qatar has one of the world's highest per capita energy consumption rates, reflecting its energy-intensive industries and high standard of living.",
        "Global energy demand typically grows at 1-2% annually, while Qatar experienced 6-7% annual growth in the 2010s, though it targets moderating to 2-3% by the late 2020s."

        "Qatar's energy growth rates show significant volatility, reflecting both global energy market fluctuations and domestic economic changes.",
        "Growth rates were particularly negative during the 2020 pandemic period, with sharp contractions across all energy sources.",
        "Post-pandemic recovery shows positive growth rates, particularly in oil consumption, which may contradict Vision 2030's sustainability goals.",
        "Qatar's historical energy demand growth of 6-7% annually significantly exceeds the global average (1-2%), highlighting the challenge of energy-intensive development.",
        "Vision 2030 and the National Environment and Climate Strategy aim to reduce these high growth rates to a more sustainable 2-3% annually by 2030, still higher than typical OECD countries that have achieved near-zero growth through efficiency measures."

        "Qatar's agricultural productivity exceeds regional peers like Oman (~$6,000) but remains well below advanced economies (>$50,000 per worker).",
        "The high per-worker value reflects Qatar's capital-intensive agricultural approach, utilizing advanced technologies like hydroponics and climate-controlled greenhouses.",
        "Following the 2017 blockade, Qatar has heavily invested in agricultural self-sufficiency, with arable land increasing by 14.75% (18,300 to 21,000 hectares).",

        "Vision 2030 doesn't discourage these fields but seeks a better balance with STEM subjects to support innovation and knowledge economy development.",
        "The inverse relationship between business/law and STEM graduates represents a challenge for Qatar's diversification - as one increases, the other tends to decrease.",
